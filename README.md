# Chaos Game

An Elixir implementation of the Chaos Game using the Scenic GUI library.

The current values generate [Sierpinski Triangles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpinski_triangle) but the logic is there for most of the other fractals produced by the chaos game to be produced.

## Usage

**Disclaimer: This project is horribly inefficient and requires a lot of processing power (it absolutely killed my laptop). However, the patterns are very nice**

1. Clone the repository
2. Install Elixir
3. `mix deps.get` inside the project
4. `mix scenic.run` inside the project
5. profit.
